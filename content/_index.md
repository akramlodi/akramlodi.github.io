# My portfolio

Hi!,
I'm Akram, a computer science major and I'm interested in the intersection of tech and business. I'm currently building pocketlink.co (the coolest link in bio tool out there). Feel free to checkout my other projects, and blogs (on all things tech, including startups, AI, and occasional ranting).


## My current projects:


### Pocketlink
**Website**: [Pocketlink.co](https://pocketlink.co)

Pocketlink is an AI powered link in bio thats optimized for sales and conversions [way better than link tree].

Studentic is a rapid revision website designed for students to learn on the go. It provides efficient, on-the-go learning tools that make revision easier and faster for students.
